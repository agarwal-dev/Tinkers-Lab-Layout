# Tinker's Lab Layout – 2D Drafting in AutoCAD

## Project Overview
This project presents a **2D floor plan layout** of *Tinker’s Lab*, created using AutoCAD as an initial reference for the physical setup of the lab. The layout was developed to assist in **visualizing space usage**, **positioning equipment**, and **planning movement flow** within the workspace.

It served as a guide during the lab setup phase, ensuring that all items were placed logically and efficiently based on available space and functionality.

## Key Features
- Drafted a **scaled 2D layout** of the lab with accurate dimensions  
- Included **equipment zones, pathways, and workstation placement**  
- Focused on **space optimization** and clear lab structure visualization  
- Aimed to support **setup planning and organization**  

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained practical experience in **AutoCAD 2D drafting**  
- Applied **space planning** and **technical drawing** concepts  
- Improved layout planning for **real-world engineering environments**

## Tools Used
- **AutoCAD 2025**  
- Drafting and Layout Modules  

## Files Included
- `TinkersLab_Layout.dwg` – Main AutoCAD drawing file  
- `TinkersLab_Layout.pdf` – Printable view of the floor plan  
- `README.md` – Project documentation
